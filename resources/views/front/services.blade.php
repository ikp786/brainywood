      <h4 class="text-left cycle_sec">Learning Cycle</h4>
      <p>It is a process by which knowledge can be converted into a skill and actionable. It completes the learning’s objectives of students and to help to become a behaviour and success attribute in student life. In the learning cycle, a piece of information is fictionalized or processed through some steps and once it gets completed, it is considered to become a skill and intelligence.</p>
      <p>There are 6 skills and steps of the learning cycle but recollection is the most important of all because all the exams are the exams of recollection skills. If the knowledge is being memorized, retained but not recollected on time then it is not appreciated and of no use, so recollection is the most important part of the education system. All the exams belong to recollection skills only. Recollection means the retrieval or recapitulation of the particular information.</p>
      <p>Learning cycle tends to be completed when reading, writing, understanding, memorization and retention are done so as to reach the 6th part i.e. recollection. And once the recollection is performed that is reckoned that knowledge is now a permanent memory and that information has become a skill.</p>
